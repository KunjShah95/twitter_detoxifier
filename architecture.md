# Twitter Extension Architecture

## Overview
This extension aims to enhance the Twitter experience by providing time-based blocking, content filtering, and usage statistics. The architecture follows a modular design pattern to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and user customization.

## Core Components

### 1. Extension Framework
- **Background Script**: Manages the extension lifecycle, handles communication between components, and maintains persistent state.
- **Content Scripts**: Inject into Twitter pages to modify DOM elements, intercept network requests, and apply filtering rules.
- **Popup Interface**: Provides user controls for configuring settings and viewing statistics.
- **Options Page**: Offers detailed configuration for all extension features.

### 2. Time-Based Blocking Module
- **Scheduler**: Manages blocking schedules based on user-defined time periods.
- **Blocker**: Implements the actual blocking mechanism by redirecting or modifying Twitter pages.
- **Override System**: Provides emergency access with optional cooldown periods.

### 3. Content Detoxification Engine
- **Content Analyzer**: Examines post content for toxic elements based on configurable rules.
- **Account Filter**: Manages lists of accounts to filter from the feed.
- **Keyword Detector**: Identifies specified keywords in text, image descriptions, and video captions.
- **Filter Action Manager**: Applies appropriate actions (hide, blur, warn) based on detection results.

### 4. Media Filter
- **Image Processor**: Analyzes and filters images based on metadata and associated text.
- **Video Handler**: Manages video content filtering based on titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
- **Review System**: Allows users to temporarily view filtered content with confirmation.

### 5. Statistics Tracker
- **Usage Monitor**: Tracks time spent on Twitter and interaction patterns.
- **Filter Counter**: Records number and types of filtered content.
- **Visualization Engine**: Generates graphs and visual representations of collected data.
- **Data Export**: Allows exporting statistics in various formats.

## Data Flow

1. When a user navigates to Twitter:
   - The background script checks if current time falls within blocking periods
   - If blocked, redirects to a blocking page or modifies the Twitter interface
   - If not blocked, initializes content filtering modules

2. For each tweet loaded:
   - Content script intercepts the tweet data
   - Passes through detoxification engine for analysis
   - If flagged, applies appropriate filtering action
   - Updates statistics

3. For media content:
   - Media filter examines images and videos
   - Applies keyword-based filtering
   - Implements appropriate visual modification (blur/hide)

4. Statistics collection:
   - Background script continuously monitors usage patterns
   - Periodically saves data to local storage
   - Updates visualization when statistics page is opened

## Storage Strategy

- **Local Storage**: User preferences, filter settings, and recent statistics
- **IndexedDB**: Historical usage data and detailed filtering logs
- **Sync Storage** (optional): Basic settings that can be synchronized across devices

## User Interface Components

1. **Popup UI**:
   - Quick toggle for enabling/disabling features
   - Timer controls for temporary blocking
   - Summary statistics display

2. **Options Page**:
   - Detailed schedule configuration
   - Keyword and account management
   - Filtering sensitivity controls
   - Statistics dashboard with visualizations

3. **Blocking Page**:
   - Displayed during blocked periods
   - Shows motivational content or custom message
   - Contains emergency override option

4. **In-Page Modifications**:
   - Filter indicators on tweets
   - Blur/hide controls for filtered content
   - Inline statistics summaries

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- All data remains local to the user's browser
- No external API calls except to Twitter's own services
- Content analysis performed locally without sending data to third parties
- Clear user consent for all monitoring features

## Extension Manifest Structure

The extension will use Manifest V3 for compatibility with modern browser requirements, with the following key components:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Twitter Detoxifier",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "alarms",
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://twitter.com/*",
    "https://x.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://twitter.com/*", "https://x.com/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  },
  "options_page": "options.html"
}
```

## Technical Implementation Approach

The extension will be implemented using:
- JavaScript ES6+ for core functionality
- HTML5 and CSS3 for user interfaces
- Chrome Extension API for browser integration
- Local storage and IndexedDB for data persistence
- D3.js for statistics visualization
